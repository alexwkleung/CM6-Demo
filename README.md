# CM6-Demo

Yet again, I created another CodeMirror 6 demo. It uses craftzdog's [cm6-themes](https://github.com/craftzdog/cm6-themes) and is inspired by [his demo site](https://cm6-themes.netlify.app/) and the good old [CodeMirror 5 demo](https://codemirror.net/5/index.html).

Written in TypeScript. Used Remark/Unified for Markdown parsing.

You can try out the demo [here](https://cm6-demo.vercel.app/).
